Design Choices and Technical Challenges
🤔 Design Philosophy
Our goal was to create a clean, efficient, and user-friendly e-commerce mobile application that demonstrates modern Flutter development practices.
🏗 Architectural Decisions
1. State Management: Riverpod
   Why Riverpod?

Provides a clean, declarative way to manage app state
Offers excellent dependency injection
Simplifies complex state scenarios
Improves code readability and maintainability

2. Navigation: Go Router
   Advantages:

Declarative routing
Type-safe route definitions
Easy navigation between screens
Supports deep linking

3. Authentication: Firebase
   Reasons for Choice:

Easy setup
Secure authentication
Built-in user management
Cross-platform support

🧩 Swift Integration Challenges
Device Information Retrieval
Technical Approach:

Used Flutter's MethodChannel for native communication
Created a Swift plugin to fetch device details
Implemented a clean, cross-platform interface

Challenges Overcome:

Bridging Flutter and Native Code

Managed method channel communication
Handled data serialization


Platform-Specific Information

Created a unified interface for device info
Ensured consistent data format across iOS and Android



Code Sample: Swift Method Channel
swiftCopypublic func getDeviceInformation() -> [String: Any] {
let device = UIDevice.current
return [
"model": device.model,
"systemName": device.systemName,
"systemVersion": device.systemVersion
]
}
🚧 Technical Challenges
1. API Integration

Handled varied API response structures
Implemented robust error handling
Created flexible data models

2. Performance Optimization

Used CachedNetworkImage for efficient image loading
Implemented lazy loading in product lists
Minimized unnecessary rebuilds with Riverpod

3. User Experience Considerations

Implemented loading states
Created intuitive navigation
Added error messages for user feedback
